Introduction: What is Python?
Python is a High-Level Programming Language, with high-level inbuilt data structures and dynamic binding. It is interpreted and an object-oriented programming language. Python distinguishes itself from other programming languages in its easy to write and understand syntax, which makes it charming to both beginners and experienced folks alike. The extensive applicability and library support of Python allow highly versatile and scalable software and products to be built on top of it in the real world.

The Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is basically a list of Python Aphorishm’s written down in a poetic manner, to best showcase the good programming practices in Python.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren’t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you’re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than right now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea – let’s do more of those!
